üöÄ **New Features:**
- `Onboarding Doctors`: We have introduced a straightforward registration process that allows doctors to register within our platform. The process has been designed to be user-friendly and efficient, making it easy for doctors to get started.

- `Doctor KYC Verification`: As a crucial step in maintaining the highest standards of patient safety and healthcare excellence, we have implemented a Know Your Customer (KYC) verification process. Doctors are requested to share their contact information, and a member of our staff will verify their identity by either making a call or sending a message.

- `Approval or Denial`: After KYC verification, the doctor's registration request is subject to approval or denial. Our administrative team carefully reviews each request, ensuring that only qualified and legitimate doctors are granted access to our platform.

**The Road Ahead**

Stay tuned for more exciting updates in the coming hours, as we continue to move forward in our mission to transform healthcare.

- `Create Prescription` (/create_prescription): We are working diligently to introduce an innovative prescription creation process. With this feature, doctors will have the option to generate prescriptions seamlessly. Whether it's handwritten images or digital alternatives, our Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology will ensure accurate processing and secure data storage. This feature will streamline the prescription creation process, making it more efficient and reliable.

- `Store User Data` (/store_user_data): To maintain data integrity and enhance patient care, we are developing a user-friendly interface that allows doctors to input patient data with lightning speed. Whether through interactive forms or messages, this feature will ensure that patient information is recorded accurately and securely. This is a critical step in providing comprehensive and precise healthcare services.
